# Project 10: What to Wear

https://project-wtwr.jumpingcrab.com/

### Overview

This is the front end of the What to Wear web application. It retrieves weather information from the [Open weather map api](https://api.openweathermap.org) and gives suggestions on what clothing to wear based on the data retrieved.

Users can register, login, logout, update user information and add, delete, and like or unlike clothing items.
Users must be logged in to logout, update user information, and manage clothing items.

User and clothing item api requests are sent to my custom back end project [se_project_express](https://github.com/nathanielDaley/se_project_express).
